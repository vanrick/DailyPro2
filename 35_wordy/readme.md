# Wordy

Write a program that takes a word problem and returns the answer as an integer.

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

## Input

A word problem.

>What is 5 plus 13?

## Output

The result of parsing and evaluating the word problem.

```js
wordy('What is 5 plus 13?') //18
```

## Note

Remember, that these are verbal word problems, not treated as you normally would treat a written problem. This means that you calculate as you move forward each step. 3 + 2 * 3 = 15, not 9.

## Examples

What is 5 plus 13?

What is 7 minus 5?
