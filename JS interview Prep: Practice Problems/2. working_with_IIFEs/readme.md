What is an IIFE and why are they used?
Code out an example of IIFE that functions properly.

//an iffe is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression. Function becomes a function expression which is immediately executed. The variable within the expression can not be accessed from outside.


//an iffe is used so you wont pollute the global scope. Therefore you can have a private scope function that doesn't effect anything outside of the scope.
