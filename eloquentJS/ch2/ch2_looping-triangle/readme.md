Each exercise starts with a problem description. Read that and try to solve the exercise. If you run into problems, consider reading the hints after the exercise. Full solutions to the exercises are not included in this book, but you can find them online at eloquentjavascript.net/code. If you want to learn something from the exercises, I recommend looking at the solutions only after you’ve solved the exercise, or at least after you’ve attacked it long and hard enough to have a slight headache.
